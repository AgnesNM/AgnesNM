## Hi there 👋

```yaml
My name is Agnes, but people mostly call me Abby.

I'm a techie who finds the most joy at the intersection of code, commmunity and content.

I like to call this "making tech accessible."

I write Python (FastPI) for my day job. In my free time, I contribute to OpenStack (Django),
lead the OpenInfra User Group Kenya, and create content about my tinkering.

My blogs:
